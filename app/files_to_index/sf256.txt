The Rehabilitation Act of 1973
The Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 701, et seq.), requires each agency in the executive branch of the Federal Government
to establish programs that will facilitate the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities. The best means of
determining agency progress in this respect is through the production of reports at certain intervals showing such things as the number
of employees with disabilities who are hired, promoted, trained, or reassigned over a given time period; the percentage of employees
with disabilities in the workforce and in various grades and occupations; etc. Such reports bring to the attention of agency top
management, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the Congress deficiencies within specific agencies or the Federal
Government as a whole in the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities and, therefore, are the essential first
step in improving these conditions and consequently meeting the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act.

The disability data collected on employees will be used only in the production of reports such as those previously mentioned and not for
any purpose that will affect them individually. The only exception to this rule is that the records may be used for selective placement
purposes and selecting special populations for mailing of voluntary personnel research surveys. In addition, every precaution will be
taken to ensure that the information provided by each employee is kept to the strictest confidence and is known only to those individuals
in the agency Personnel Office who obtain and record the information for entry into the agency's and OPM's personnel systems. You
should also be aware that participation in the disability reporting system is entirely voluntary, with the exception of employees
appointed under Schedule A, SECTION 213.3102(u) (Severe physical or mental disabilities). These employees will be requested
to identify their disability status and if they decline to do so, their correct disability code will be obtained from medical documentation
used to support their appointment.

Employees will be given every opportunity to ensure that the disability code carried in their agency's and OPM's personnel systems is
accurate and is kept current. They may exercise this opportunity by asking their Personnel Officer to see a printout of the code and
definition from their records . The code carried on employees in the agency's system will be identical to that carried in OPM's system.

Your cooperation and assistance in establishing and maintaining an accurate and up-to-date disability report system is sincerely
appreciated.




Privacy Act Statement
Collection of the requested information is authorized by the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 701, et seq.). Solicitation of your
Social Security Number (SSN) is authorized by Executive Order 9397, which permits agencies to use the SSN as the means for
identifying persons with disabilities in personnel information systems. Your SSN will only be used to ensure that your correct disability
code is recorded along with other employee information that your agency and OPM maintain on you. Furnishing your SSN or any other
data requested for this collection effort is voluntary and failure to do so will have no effect on you. It should be noted, however, that
where individuals decline to furnish their SSN, the SSN will be obtained from other records in order to ensure accurate and complete
data. Employees appointed under Schedule A, Section 213.3102 (u) (Severe physical or mental disabilities) are requested to furnish an
accurate disability code, but failure to do so will not affect them. Where employees hired under one of these appointing authorities fail to
disclose their disability(ies), however, the appropriate code will be determined from the employee's existing records or medical
documentation physically submitted upon appointment.
